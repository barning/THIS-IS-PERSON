THIS IS PERSON
===================

This is a JavaScript application that uses [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) libraries to detect and track objects in real-time video streams. The app utilizes [COCO-SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd), a pre-trained machine learning model for object detection.

Features
--------

*   Real-time object detection using the COCO-SSD model
*   Generates a random object to detect each day
*   Displays a prompt with the detected object to find
*   Timer with countdown to complete the task
*   Share image on social media
*   Copy link to share with friends

Usage
-----

To use the app, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. You will be prompted to allow camera access. After allowing access, the app will start detecting objects in real-time.

When a random object is generated, a prompt will appear at the bottom of the screen with the object to find. The user must find the object within a set amount of time to complete the task. Once the task is completed, a share button will appear to share the image on social media.

There are also dialog buttons to open additional information such as instructions, statistics, and credits.

Installation
------------

No installation is required. Simply clone or download the repository and open `index.html` in a web browser.
